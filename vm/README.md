## H2 Virtual Machine

This is a virtual machine for the H2 CPU, it should allow for faster development
on slower computers or at least as a part of a system for automatic verification
and comparisons between this and the VHDL implementation.

### TODO

* Vigorous testing of both this VM and the VHDL implementation
* Expand capabilities to include all the peripherals.
* Automatic comparison of outputs
