H2 Virtual Machine
==================

As of "Mon May 27 17:00:17 BST 2013" the virtual machine is still a work in progress,
there is a lot to do in order to make this program fully functional. It should be
able to read specially marked up input data as input for all the peripherals and be
able to output the correct signals that the system on a chip would. In the beginning
however a simulation of the CPU core only is necessary.

TODO
----

* Implement the Virtual Machine for the H2 CPU
* Expand capabilities to include all the peripherals.
