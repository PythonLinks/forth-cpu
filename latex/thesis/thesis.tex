	\begin{abstract}
    The goal of this project is to create a computing system in VHDL from the
    ground up in order to make a product that is useful for both teaching and
    eventually much more. This project includes the firmware and the toolchain
    that is to target the device.

  \section{Introduction}

  The idea of this project is to create an educational system for electrical
  engineers who are studying VHDL that can be eventually developed into something 
  more useful, and still have those engineers in mind. 

  \section{Project Goals}
  % Ease of use, modularity, code portability.

  \section{Tools used}
  
  As this project is entirely software based you will need a list of all the tools
  I have chosen, that will be included in this section as well as why I have used
  these tools.

  \section{VHDL}
    \subsection{J1}
    \subsection{H2}
    \subsection{VGA}
    \subsection{USART}
    \subsection{RAM and other inferred modules}
      % Read from a file.
    \subsection{Top level}
  \section{Build system}
    \subsection{Test benches}
    \subsection{FORTH}
    \subsection{Miscellaneous}
      % Git, make, shell.
  \section{Future plans}
    \subsection{Firmware}
  \section{Documentation}

  In this section I will provide a terse (terse in the sense that this should
  be its own paper) about the system.

    \subsection{FORTH interpreter}
      \subsubsection{The C Program}
      %   IOCCC
      \subsubsection{Basic commands and ideas}
      % References to other tutorials.
    \subsection{H2 CPU}
      \subsubsection{Assembly}
