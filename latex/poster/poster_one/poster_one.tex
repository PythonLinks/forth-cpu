\subsection{The Project}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{devBoard.jpg}
\end{center}

Using a Nexys 3 Development board\cite{nexysDigilent}, as shown above,
I have created a portable computing system in VHDL intended for students
like myself. The project is extensible and module, and as I have said
it is also portable using no resources specific to Xilinx which would
allow the system to be moved to smaller, cheaper devices.

The CPU core is based around a processor originally written in Verilog
called the J1\cite{j1core}. This has been rewritten in VHDL and modified
due to it being less constrained in the projects scope like the original
was. The processor is stack based which allows for a system which uses
less space and can execute many FORTH instructions natively.

\subsection{Resource Utilization}
The entire system takes up very little room on the device (6slx16csg324-3)
on a Nexys 3 Development board. This would allow for further expansion of
the system and even multiple processor cores running simultaneously. Alternatively
it could mean porting to a cheaper system while not reducing any functionality.
\begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Slice Registers : 295 out of 18224 (1\%).
        \item Slice LUTs: 789 out of 9112 (8\%).
        \item BRAMs 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 4096x8 bit dual-port RAM, 2 (VGA Memory).
                \item 8192x16 bit dual-port RAM, 1 (CPU Core).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}

In addition to these, also not listed is adders, comparators, subtracters, etcetera 
that have also been used by the design.

\headerbox{Firmware}

The firmware is a simple bootloader, instead of compiling the program in as you would
once the development is over, I have made a simple program that resides on the device
that allows you to load an arbitrary program onto the core. 

In order to both help me out with the build (converting file formats) I had to make
an assembler and decided to go with a language I had written (FORTH) that is particularly
well suited to the task, the assembler requires just a few hundred more lines of code
to define what is necessary and the original language can be called from it.
