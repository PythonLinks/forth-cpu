Once the CORDIC module I have is made it would be interesting to create multiple
variants, optimized for different things. For example a bit serial version. The
algorithm can also be tailored to computer more than *just* sine and cosines of
angles, a more generic version of the algorithm would be very useful.

CORDIC:

This module is a must because it can be used for *so* much.
