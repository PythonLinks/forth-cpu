## readme.md for the H2 Compiler

The idea of this subproject is to create a C compiler for a *strict* and
*limited* subset of C, which you could compile and run either on the H2 CPU or
on the PC for testing, so the C code must be written for that in mind. 

The normal C preprocessor will be used, one will not be recreated unnecessarily.
