# ucpu.md
## A micro CPU

An incredibly small CPU.

## To Do

* Test uCPU fully, make sure it synthesizes, and check what it synthesizes to
* Try to cut down code size, and experiment with the CPU
* Work on interface and initialization routines
* Make assembler
	- A partial assembler could be made in VHDL
* Make test programs
* Move to "util.vhd"
* Document fully
* Make a simulator in C
* Make a bit serial version?
