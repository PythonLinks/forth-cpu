# Prototype for H2 SoC simulator

This is a prototype for a H2 GUI based simulator, which will display the VGA,
switches, D-Pad, LEDs, and 8-Segment LED displays and allow user input (for 
the switches and D-Pad). The keyboard could also be simulated by typing, as
could the UART. The UART transmission will require a text box of its own.

This is just a skeleton, and is not actually functional at the moment.
