* FORTH word, change current vocabulary. 

* Improve assembler.

Loops and if statements


* It is possible that I could implement the
  Virtual machine here as well.

=====

* Work on input/output more.

* Implement simple bootloader as firmware.

* top\_level.vhd

* VGA and UART top levels and testing.

Move out the I/O section into its own module.

What might be interesting is using some spare
dual port RAM as a UART buffer, and reading from
the buffers instead of handling the UART directly.

* Documentation.

* Edit all modules so they have a uniform naming
convention and style.

* Add my public keys to the repo.
