The assembler is currently a work in progress, it is simple and limited at the moment with a lot to do. It is only a few hundred lines of F\-O\-R\-T\-H, written in a dialect that I have made. The manual for this dialect is included in this repository, which contains pointers back to the original repo for this F\-O\-R\-T\-H.
